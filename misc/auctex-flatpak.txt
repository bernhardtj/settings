flatpak override --env=FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT='*' org.gnu.emacs

NOTE

1.
Extensions only work if the Sdk from which the extension is derived the SAME as that of the emacs app. There is typically only 1 year version of texlive that works!

flatpak info --show-runtime org.gnu.emacs
flatpak info --show-runtime org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive

2.
